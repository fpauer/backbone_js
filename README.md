# Examples in Backbone 1.3.3

Some examples using the main features of Backbone.js.

## Some concepts about Backbone

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library, among many others, it’s ease of use and the structure that it provides to JavaScript applications.

Notice that BackboneJS is not a framework but a library. The difference is who is in control. Using a library YOU are in control, but using a framework there is an inversion of control: the framework calls you. Libraries give you a lot of flexibility, while frameworks has opinionated ways of doing things but can save you writing boiler plate code.
